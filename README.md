# BlockchainiOSApp

<b>Educative iOS App on the Logic of Blockchain Technology.</b>

This is a simple application to understand how blockchain smart 
contract transactions work in the backend with the JSON output:
- Type in the provider name and the destinator.
- Insert the amount, domestic no fees applies, international 0.2%. 
See this application as an educational experiment.

Once you validate the transaction by pressing on the “Send” button, you’ll see the transaction information but also the hash generated from the 
transaction and the nonce number which you’ve created to define your block.

Go in “See all transactions” to see all blocks you’ve created starting from the genesis block.

*Future releases will make it possible to connect transactions and 
mining between different users through Personal Hotspot.
